About
=====

I’m a senior Computer Science student at Stanford University specializing in embedded AI and machine learning systems. I build end-to-end solutions—from data collection and preprocessing to model optimization and on-device deployment.

Core Competencies
-----------------
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, PEFT (LoRA, Adapter), Vision Transformers (ViT), CNNs, transfer learning, quantization, pruning  
- **Audio & Signal Processing:** Spectrogram generation, custom BirdNET classifier training, Fréchet Audio Distance, KL divergence  
- **Edge & Embedded Systems:** TFLite model conversion, real-time audio inference pipelines, sliding-window capture, memory/latency optimization  
- **Software Engineering:** Python (asyncio, multiprocessing), C/C++ (embedded), React & Tailwind UI, RESTful APIs, Git/GitHub, CI/CD (GitHub Actions)  
- **Performance Profiling & Optimization:** TensorBoard, TFLite Benchmark, custom microbenchmarks, cross-compilation toolchains  

Selected Projects
-----------------
- **Endangered Bird Call Classifier:** Collected and annotated wetland audio; fine-tuned BirdNET embeddings; optimized a TFLite model achieving <50 ms inference on ARM Cortex-A53.  
- **On-Device PEFT Prototype:** Implemented LoRA adapters for a 5 MB transformer to enable continual learning on resource-constrained hardware.  
- **Real-Time Audio Streaming Pipeline:** Developed a low-latency Python/C++ pipeline for sliding-window feature extraction and classification, sustaining 30 FPS on Raspberry Pi Zero.  
- **Automated Model Validation Suite:** Built a CI/CD workflow with pytest and custom metrics for AUROC/AUPRC tracking across TensorFlow and TFLite variants.
